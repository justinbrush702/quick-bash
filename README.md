# quick-bash

After working in a bunch of different machines (local, vm, ec2-instance, etc.), I have cultivated a handful of universal commands that I find helpful in any environment.

### How to use

Add any commands you like to your .bash_profile or other bash files (I primarily work with .bash_profile.). You can copy and paste the functions into the bash profile of your choosing. Once you run 'source <bash_file>', you'll have access to these functions. Enjoy!
